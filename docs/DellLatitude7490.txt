Linux graphics
--------------

The kernel crashes frequently with graphical glitches. Add the following
to the kernel command line to prevent this:

    i915.enable_psr=0 i915.enable_dc=0


NetBSD
------

NetBSD 10 requires the i915drmkms firmware to be installed, and the pms
module to be disabled.

Download the Linux firmware file from the URL below:

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/i915

The required filename can be found from dmesg, and should be copied to:

   /libdata/firmware/i915drmkms/i915

The enable_psr setting should also be changed in /etc/sysctl.conf with
the following line:

   hw.drm2.i915_modparams.enable_psr=0

Finally, the pms module should be disabled by adding the following to
the end of the /boot.cfg file:

   userconf=disable pms*
