Dell Latitude 7490
==================

Graphics
--------

The kernel crashes frequently with graphical glitches. Add the following
to the kernel command line to prevent this:

    i915.enable_psr=0


Crashes when locking or sleeping
--------------------------------

Still working out the cause for this one. Current troubleshooting steps
have been:

  - Using X11 instead of Wayland: FAILED
  - Using KDE Plasma instead of Gnome: FAILED
  - Using XDM instead of GDM: FAILED
  - Masking rtkit-daemon.service: FAILED
  - Using newer kernel from Debian Backports: FAILED
  - Using Fedora instead of Debian: FAILED
  - Adding i915.modeset=0 to the boot line: FAILED
  - Adding acpi_osi='Windows 2019' to the boot line: TESTING

Currently the "acpi_osi='Windows 2019'" kernel option seems to be
working.
