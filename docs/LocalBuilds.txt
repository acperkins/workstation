                       Local builds in ~/data/opt


Introduction

   On machines without root access, or without a package manager (such
   as MacOS), it can be useful to build applications into the home
   directory.


1. Basic applications

   Most applications can be installed with the following triplet:

      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/data/opt/app
      make -j4
      make -j4 install


2. Applications with extra libraries

   If an application needs extra libraries, these can be installed into
   the app directory first, with the same commands as above.

   When the main application is built, you will need to tell the build
   system and the application where to find the libraries. This is done
   as so:

      app=$HOME/data/opt/app
      ./configure --prefix=$app \
                  CFLAGS="-I$app/include" \
                  LDFLAGS="-L$app/lib -Wl,-rpath $app/lib"
      make -j4
      make -j4 install
